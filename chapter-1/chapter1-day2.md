# Chapter 1 - Day 2

## What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?
The five pillars of the Cadence programming language are:  (1) Safety and Security; (2) Clarity; (3) Approachability; (4) Developer Experience; and (5) Resource Oriented Programming

## In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?
For (1) Safety and Security, smart contracts must be secure.  Cadence is strongly typed, creates separation between contracts and transactions, and relies on resource oriented programming.

For (2) Clarity, the code is declarative making it easy to read allowing useres to verify if its safe.  

For (3) Approachability, Cadence is similar to other programming languages making it easy to transition for most developers.

For (4) Developer Experience, Cadence makes error messages user friendly by making them very clear.
